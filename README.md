# Image_analysis_breast_cancer
In this project two mamograms are compared. One with cancer and another without cancer 
A SSIM of 0.37 indicates a relatively low resemblance between the two photos in the context of cancer and non-cancer breast tissue. This could imply that the two types of tissue have major structural variations, which could be symptomatic of malignant growths.
